# word-game
This is a simple word game in python, it uses an external file as the wordlist for getting the words.
IN line 7, change the directory to your current folder's directory. e.g "C:users\\mypc\\myprojects\\python". The program and the wordlist should be in the same folder.
Make sure to change the name of the txt file containing the words if you have other.
